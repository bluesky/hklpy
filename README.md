hklpy
=====

Controls for using diffractometers within the [Bluesky
Framework](https://blueskyproject.io).

Based on the *hkl*  C++ library (described here as [*libhkl*](https://people.debian.org/~picca/hkl/hkl.html#)), with
slightly cleaner abstractions when compared to the auto-generated
`gobject-introspection` classes. Integrates with ophyd
pseudopositioners.

**TIP**: Always import the ``gobject-introspection`` package first
and require ``Hkl`` version 5.0, as in:

```python
import gi
gi.require_version('Hkl', '5.0')

from hkl import E4CV
# note: before v1.0 release use:
# from hkl.geometries import E4CV
```

**NOTE**: main repository: https://repo.or.cz/hkl.git (GitHub repo
